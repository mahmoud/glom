glom
====

*Restructuring data, the Python way.*

|release| |calver| |changelog|

**glom** is a new approach to working with data in Python, featuring:

* :ref:`Path-based access <access-granted>` for nested structures
* :ref:`Declarative data transformation <glom-func>` using lightweight, Pythonic specifications
* Readable, meaningful :ref:`error messages <exceptions>`
* Built-in :ref:`debugging <debugging>` features
* Plus, :doc:`deep assignment <mutation>`, :doc:`streaming <streaming>`, :doc:`data validation <matching>`, and *more*!

While it may sound like a lot, glom's straightforward approach becomes
second-nature very quickly. Start with the :doc:`tutorial<tutorial>`, 
or `try glom in your browser now`__!

Installation
------------

glom is pure Python, and tested on Python 3.8+, as well as
PyPy3. Installation is easy::

  pip install glom

Then you're ready to get glomming!

.. code-block:: python

   from glom import glom

   target = {'a': {'b': {'c': 'd'}}}
   glom(target, 'a.b.c')  # returns 'd'

There's much, much more to glom, check out the :doc:`tutorial` and :doc:`API reference<api>`!
