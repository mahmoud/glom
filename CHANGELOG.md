# glom's CHANGELOG

glom is a growing library! This document is a record of its growth.

The glom team's approach to updates can be summed up as:

- Always maintaining backwards compatibility
- [CalVer](https://calver.org) versioning scheme (`YY.MM.MICRO`)
- Stay streamlined. glom should be a well-designed bicycle, not an
  aircraft carrier.

Check this page when upgrading, we strive to keep the updates
summarized and well-linked.

## 24.11.0

_(November 2, 2024)_

- Add support for Python 3.12, dropping pre-Python 3.7 syntax.
- Add `--scalar` flag to CLI to enable cleaner way to get single values at the console and in scripts
- Upgrade requirements, fixing `face` pin (see [issue 284][i284]

[i284]: https://github.com/mahmoud/glom/issues/284

## 23.5.0

_(November 26, 2023)_

Add TOML support to the CLI. Thanks, [Julian](https://github.com/Julian)!
Uses the built-in [tomllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tomllib.html) on Python 3.11+.
`pip install glom[toml]` on Python 3.10 and earlier.

## 23.4.0

_(November 7, 2023)_

Officially add Python 3.11 support, fixing traceback formatting issues.

Also, change the implementation of T under the hood, no expected behavioral changes.

## 23.3.0

_(March 30, 2023)_

Officially drop Python 2/3.6 support and fix a small warning caused by a docstring ([#258][i258]).

[i258]: https://github.com/mahmoud/glom/issues/258

## 23.1.1

_(January 19, 2023)_

Fix a dependency issue by pinning the `face` library.

## 23.1.0

_(January 18, 2023)_

Note: Planned last release to support Python 2.

Two long-awaited big changes in this release, with a couple smaller ones:

- Enabled the star/wildcard (`*`/`**`) behavior initially released in 22.1.0 (see below) by default.
  - If you had a spec broken by this, you can quick-fix it without downgrading by setting `glom.core.PATH_STAR = False`.
  - You can fix the broken paths by using the `Path` spec type explicitly, e.g., `Path('a', '*')` instead of simply `'a.*'`.
  - `**` now includes the current target element itself. Useful for `**`-prefixed specs (e.g., `'**.key'`) so that the root element is considered.
- Rationalized argument behavior for several spec types
  - Affected spec types: `Coalesce, Call, T, Match, And, Or, Not, Check, Assign`
  - In short, before 23.1.0, each of these implemented their own logic around interpreting arguments. Some treated them as literals, others had varying support for specs.
  - Now they all use `glom.core.arg_val` to consistently handle arguments. In brief, they now all support conservative evaluation of specs (such as explicit `T` objects), very useful for when you want your spec's `default` to reference the target.
  - More docs forthcoming.
  - We did our best to make this as seamless and sane as possible. If this breaks something, please file an issue, we're eager to hear from you.
- Patched an issue where OrderedDict would be treated as a plain object by Delete ([#246][i246]).
  - Even better fix forthcoming.
- Tweaked `Iter()` to use `Pipe()` for `.all()`, mostly for benefits to the repr.

[i246]: https://github.com/mahmoud/glom/issues/246

## 22.1.0

_(January 24, 2022)_

Adds optional `*` and `**` expansion to the default glom access (i.e.,
`glom.glom('a.b.*')` will get all items under `b` as a list). `**` is
similar, except recursive.

This functionality is off by default in this version, as it
technically would break code using `'*'` and `'**'` as plain
keys. Note that this behavior will break in the next couple months,
and an in-library warning has been added to this effect.

Set `glom.core.PATH_STAR = True` to enable the new feature and take it
for a spin!

## 20.11.0

_(November 3, 2020)_

- The `T` object now supports arithmetic operators!
- A few internal performance improvements around chainmap, scope, and string path eval.

  20.8.0

---

_(August 11, 2020)_

A few cleanups from the big release:

- PathAccessError paths are now Path objects again (fixes [#185][i185])
- Fix an intermittent infinite recursion due to a suspected bug in
  abc, and a bad interaction between ChainMap and weakref. (fixes [#189][i189])
- Adjust face requirement version to be more strictly up-to-date ([#188][i188])
- Soft launch the Pipe() spec, which is just a more explicit version
  of the default tuple behavior. ([#191][i191])

Huge thanks to all reporters and committers!

## 20.7.0

_(July 31, 2020)_

glom releases don't come bigger than this.

- [Match mode][matching] - Data validation and pattern matching. You're
  going to have to read the docs to believe it.
- Complete documenation refactor
  - [API][core_api] now split into domains ([Mutation][mutation], [Streaming][streaming], [Grouping][grouping], [Matching][matching])
  - New [debugging and exception guide][debugging]
  - New advanced glom intro: [glom Modes][modes]
- Traceback simplification and _Target-spec trace_
  - glom no longer displays glom-internal stack frames, which were not
    useful for developers debugging specs and data.
  - Instead, the exception message displays summarized intermediate
    targets and specs, to help drill down to the part of the data or
    spec which raised the error.
  - To restore previous behavior, or if you need to see internal stack
    frames, pass `glom_debug=True` to the top-level `glom()` call, or
    set the `GLOM_DEBUG` env var to `1`.
  - For more details see the [debugging guide][debugging].
- [Scope][scope] updates
  - [`S()` and `A`][scope_assign] (replaces the previously soft-launched `Let()`)
  - [Vars()][vars]: Non-local scopes
- `T.__()` method for accessing dunder attributes (see applicable note under [T][T])
- `glom.__version__` - importable version attribute

## 20.5.0

_(May 2, 2020)_

- Added [delete() and Delete()][delete], for deletion of keys and attributes
- Added [Ref()][ref_spec] specifier type for recursive specs
- Added [Group()][group_spec] for structural grouping, like a souped-up [bucketize][boltons_bucketize]

## 19.10.0

_(October 29, 2019)_

- Add streaming support via [Iter][iter] ([#100][i100])
- Add better callable handling with [Invoke][invoke] ([#101][i101])
- Add Fill ([#110][i110]) - Also adds Auto for the default mode. (soft-launch, docs TBA)
- Add Let for variable capture ([#108][i108]) (soft-launch, docs TBA)
- Steps in the tuple now nest scopes ([#97][i97])
- All public specifier types now have reasonable reprs (notably, Coalesce, Check, and Assign)

## 19.2.0

_(February 17, 2019)_

Add [`Merge()` spec and `merge()` convenience
function](https://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grouping.html#glom.merge).
for turning iterables of mappings into a single mapping.

Additionally, `T` and `Spec()` instances which appear in the "key"
portion of the default dict/mapping spec, are now evaluated, enabling
operations [like this](https://github.com/mahmoud/glom/issues/85),
which demonstrates both new features:

```python

from glom import glom, T, Merge

target = [{"id": 1, "name": "foo"}, {"id": 2, "name": "bar"}]
spec = Merge([{T["id"]: T["name"]}])

glom(target, spec)
# {1: 'foo', 2: 'bar'}
```

## 19.1.0

_(January 20, 2019)_

Added features related to folding/reducing sequences. Read more about
`Fold`, `Sum`, `Flatten`, and `flatten`
[here](https://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grouping.html#combining-iterables-with-flatten-and-merge).

Also switched CalVer version scheme to `YY.MM.MICRO`.

## 18.4.0

_(December 25, 2018)_

A couple features related to
[`assign()`](https://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mutation.html#glom.assign)
and other minor additions and fixes.

- Add new `missing` parameter to `assign()`, to autogenerate new
  datastructures at paths that don't exist. Read more at the bottom of
  the [`Assign` spec docstring](https://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mutation.html#glom.Assign).
- Allow `Assign` to operate on `S`-based specs to assign to the spec.
- Add the [`STOP` singleton](https://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#glom.STOP).
  `STOP` is to [`SKIP`](https://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#glom.SKIP)
  what `break` is to `continue`. Useful as a default with conditional specs like
  [`Check()`](https://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matching.html#validation-with-check).

## 18.3.1

---

_(August 22, 2018)_

Fix a small bug where `Assign()` raised a `TypeError` instead of a
`GlomError` subtype. This release added
[`PathAssignError`](https://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#glom.PathAssignError),
which is now raised instead.

## 18.3.0

_(August 14, 2018)_

This release introduces the `Assign` Spec type, and its accompanying
`glom.assign()` "deep-set" convenience function, a feature that
required the refinement of glom's Extension API. `Path` and `T` also
saw improvements.

- `Assign` Spec type and `glom.assign()` top-level function for deep setting.
- Extensions (and advanced users) can now register new operations. For
  instance, `Assign` registers `"assign"`, which is now a peer of
  `"get"` and `"iterate"`, which were the only built-in operations
  glom provided.
- Extensions no longer need to be registered. A `glom` extension is an
  instance of any type that provides a `glomit()` method. Full docs
  coming soon.
- `T` and other `TType` instances now pickle correctly, fixing [#48][i48]
- `Path` instances now behave like strings, with indexing returning
  new `Path` objects, with full slice syntax support.
- `Path` also supports `.values()` and `.items()` methods, which
  enable getting sequences of the data backing the `Path()`, for when
  a sub-`Path` object is not desirable.
- `Path` objects are now comparable for equality. To compare a `T`,
  simply wrap it in a `Path()` use the `==` operator.

## 18.2.0

_(July 5, 2018)_

This sizable release incorporates a lot of the post-announcement
feedback. Several advanced features were added, including an extension
API and "Scope" support. While this involved a large refactor, all
external APIs are 100% backwards-compatible.

In other good news, coverage is up over 90% and on track to go even
higher. Check out all the well-tested enhancements below!

- Introduce the `glom`'s first-class Extension system. Docs are a work
  in progress, but given that all the internals are implemented in
  terms of the system, don't hesitate to look under the hood and start
  experimenting. Addresses [#9][i9].
- The Extension system involved a runtime refactor to add a concept of
  "scope" to `glom`. Until now, glom has only supported operating on a
  single "target", making it the only object in scope. Now, it's also
  possible to add other objects to the scope, making multi-target
  glomming a reality for advanced users.
- Add initial version of `Check()`, a specifier type aimed at
  providing target validation while glomming. Addresses [#7][i7].
- Make `Spec` work for object-oriented glom use. Usage is similar to
  Python's `re.compile`: predefine a `Spec` object, call
  `spec.glom(target)` later. Addresses [#14][i14]
- Add YAML support to CLI. PyYAML was added as an "extras" dependency
  and is not installed by default. glom will pick up any existing
  installed yaml library and use that, or you can `pip install
glom[yaml]` to explicitly install support. See [#26][i26] for
  details. Thanks @dfezzie!
- Made `T` and `Path` share evaluation, repr, and exception paths, closing [#6][i6]
- add `default_factory` argument to Coalesce, with semantics identical
  to Python's built-in defaultdict.

Still in semi-public beta. This release added `T` objects and better
error messages.

## 18.0.0

_(April 30, 2018)_

Semi-public beta release. Most of the functionality glom had on
[announcement][initial_announce].

## 0.0.1

_(April 18, 2018)_

Barely more than a function definition. For the historically-oriented,
here's a [blast from the
past](https://github.com/mahmoud/glom/blob/186757b47af3d33901df4bf715874b5f3c781d8f/glom/__init__.py#L74-L91),
representing the core of glom functionality.
