Dealing with Data
=================

Every application deals with data, and these days, even the simplest
applications deal with rich, heavily-nested data.

What does nested data look like? In its most basic form::

  >>> data = {'a': {'b': {'c': 'd'}}}
  >>> data['a']['b']['c']
  'd'

Pretty simple right? On a good day, it certainly can be. But other
days, a value might not be set::

  >>> data2 = {
  ...     'a': {
  ...         'b': None
  ...     }
  ... }
  >>> data2['a']['b']['c']
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable

Well that's no good. We didn't get our value. We got a TypeError, a
type of error that doesn't help us at all. The error message doesn't
even tell us which access failed. If ``data2`` had been passed to us,
we wouldn't know if ``'a'``, ``'b'``, or ``'c'`` had been set to
``None``.

If only there were a more semantically powerful accessor.

.. _access-granted:

Accessing Nested Data
=====================
*AKA "Access Granted"*

After years of research and countless iterations, the glom team landed
on this simple construct::

  >>> glom(data, 'a.b.c')
  'd'

Well that's short, and reads fine, but what about in the error case?

  >>> glom(data2, 'a.b.c')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  PathAccessError: could not access 'c', index 2 in path Path('a', 'b', 'c'), got error: ...

That's more like it! We have a function that can give us our data, or
give us an error message we can read, understand, and act upon.

And would you believe this "deep access" example doesn't even scratch
the surface of the tip of the iceberg? Welcome to glom.

Going Beyond Access
===================

To start out, let's introduce some basic terminology:

- *target* is our data, be it a dict, list, or any other object
- *spec* is what we want *output* to be

With ``output = glom(target, spec)`` committed to memory, we're ready for some new requirements.

Let's follow some astronomers on their journey exploring the solar system.

  >>> target = {
  ...     'galaxy': {
  ...         'system': {
  ...             'planet': 'jupiter'
  ...         }
  ...     }
  ... }
  >>> spec = 'galaxy.system.planet'
  >>> glom(target, spec)
  'jupiter'

Our astronomers want to focus in on the Solar system, and represent planets as a list.
Let's restructure the data to make a list of names:

  >>> target = {
  ...     'system': {
  ...         'planets': [
  ...             {'name': 'earth'},
  ...             {'name': 'jupiter'}
  ...         ]
  ...     }
  ... }
  >>> glom(target, ('system.planets', ['name']))
  ['earth', 'jupiter']

And let's say we want to capture a parallel list of moon counts with the names as well:

  >>> target = {
  ...     'system': {
  ...         'planets': [
  ...             {'name': 'earth', 'moons': 1},
  ...             {'name': 'jupiter', 'moons': 69}
  ...         ]
  ...     }
  ... }
  >>> spec = {
  ...     'names': ('system.planets', ['name']),
  ...     'moons': ('system.planets', ['moons'])
  ... }
  >>> pprint(glom(target, spec))
  {'moons': [1, 69], 'names': ['earth', 'jupiter']}

We can react to changing data requirements as fast as the data itself can change, naturally restructuring our results,
despite the input's nested nature. Like a list comprehension, but for nested data, our code mirrors our output.

Handling Nested Lists
=====================
In the example above we introduced a new wrinkle: the target for ``planets`` has multiple
entries stored in a list. Previously our targets were all nested dictionaries.

To handle this we use a new *spec* pattern: ``(path, [subpath])``. In this pattern ``path`` is the path
to the list, and ``subpath`` is the path within each element of the list. What's that? You need to handle
lists within lists (within lists ...)? Then just repeat the pattern, replacing ``subpath`` with another
``(path, [subpath])`` tuple. For example, say we have information about each planet's moons like so:

  >>> target = {
  ...     'system': {
  ...         'planets': [
  ...             {
  ...                 'name': 'earth',
  ...                 'moons': [
  ...                     {'name': 'luna'}
  ...                 ]
  ...             },
  ...             {
  ...                 'name': 'jupiter',
  ...                 'moons': [
  ...                     {'name': 'io'},
  ...                     {'name': 'europa'}
  ...                 ]
  ...             }
  ...         ]
  ...     }
  ... }

We can get the names of each moon from our nested lists by nesting our subpath specs:

  >>> spec = {
  ...     'planet_names': ('system.planets', ['name']),
  ...     'moon_names': ('system.planets', [('moons', ['name'])])
  ... }
  >>> pprint(glom(target, spec))
  {'moon_names': [['luna'], ['io', 'europa']], 'planet_names': ['earth', 'jupiter']}

Changing Requirements
=====================

Unfortunately, data in the real world is messy. You might be expecting a certain format and end up getting something
completely different. No worries, glom to the rescue.

**Coalesce** is a glom construct that allows you to specify fallback behavior for a list of subspecs.
Subspecs are passed as positional arguments, while defaults can be set using keyword arguments.

Let's say our astronomers recently got a new update in their systems, and sometimes ``system`` will contain
``dwarf_planets`` instead of ``planets``.

To handle this, we can define the ``dwarf_planets`` subspec as a Coalesce fallback.

  >>> from glom import Coalesce
  >>> target = {
  ...     'system': {
  ...         'planets': [
  ...             {'name': 'earth', 'moons': 1},
  ...             {'name': 'jupiter', 'moons': 69}
  ...         ]
  ...     }
  ... }
  >>> spec = {
  ...     'planets': (Coalesce('system.planets', 'system.dwarf_planets'), ['name']),
  ...     'moons': (Coalesce('system.planets', 'system.dwarf_planets'), ['moons'])
  ... }
  >>> pprint(glom(target, spec))
  {'moons': [1, 69], 'planets': ['earth', 'jupiter']}

You can see here we get the expected results, but say our target changes...

  >>> target = {
  ...     'system': {
  ...         'dwarf_planets': [
  ...             {'name': 'pluto', 'moons': 5},
  ...             {'name': 'ceres', 'moons': 0}
  ...         ]
  ...     }
  ... }
  >>> pprint(glom(target, spec))
  {'moons': [5, 0], 'planets': ['pluto', 'ceres']}

Voila, the target can still be parsed and we can elegantly handle changes in our data formats.

Data-Driven Assignment
======================

Quite often APIs deliver data in dictionaries without constant key values.
They use parts of the data itself as a key. This we call data-driven assignment.

The following example shows you a way to handle this situation.
It extracts the moon count from a dictionary that has the planet names as a key.

  >>> from glom import glom, T, Merge, Iter, Coalesce
  >>> target = {
  ...    "pluto": {"moons": 6, "population": None},
  ...    "venus": {"population": {"aliens": 5}},
  ...    "earth": {"moons": 1, "population": {"humans": 7700000000, "aliens": 1}},
  ... }
  >>> spec = {
  ...     "moons": (
  ...          T.items(),
  ...          Iter({T[0]: (T[1], Coalesce("moons", default=0))}),
  ...          Merge(),
  ...     )
  ... }
  >>> pprint(glom(target, spec))
  {'moons': {'earth': 1, 'pluto': 6, 'venus': 0}}

Don't worry if you do not fully understand how this works at this
point. If you would like to learn more, look up :class:`~glom.Iter()`,
:data:`~glom.T`, or :class:`~glom.Merge` in the glom API reference.

True Python Native
==================

Most other implementations are limited to a particular data format or pure model, be it jmespath or XPath/XSLT.
glom makes no such sacrifices of practicality, harnessing the full power of Python itself.

Going back to our example, let's say we wanted to get an aggregate moon count:

  >>> target = {
  ...     'system': {
  ...         'planets': [
  ...             {'name': 'earth', 'moons': 1},
  ...             {'name': 'jupiter', 'moons': 69}
  ...         ]
  ...     }
  ... }
  >>> pprint(glom(target, {'moon_count': ('system.planets', ['moons'], sum)}))
  {'moon_count': 70}

With glom, you have full access to Python at any given moment.
Pass values to functions, whether built-in, imported, or defined inline with lambda.

Practical Production Use
========================
*AKA "Point of Contact"*

glom is a practical tool for production use. To best demonstrate how
you can use it, we'll be building an API response. We're implementing
a Contacts web service, like an address book, but backed by an
ORM/database and compatible with web and mobile frontends.

Let's create a Contact to familiarize ourselves with our test data:
pri
  >>> from glom.tutorial import *  # import the tutorial module members
  >>> contact = Contact('Julian',
  ...                   emails=[Email(email='jlahey@svtp.info')],
  ...                   location='Canada')
  >>> contact.save()
  >>> contact.primary_email
  Email(id=5, email='jlahey@svtp.info', email_type='personal')
  >>> contact.add_date
  datetime.datetime(...)
  >>> contact.id
  5

As you can see, the Contact object has fields for ``primary_email``,
defaulting to the first email in the email list, and ``add_date``, to
track the date the contact was added. And as the unique,
autoincrementing ``id`` suggests, there appear to be a few other
contacts already in our system.

  >>> len(Contact.objects.all())
  5

Sure enough, we've got a little address book going here. But right now
it consists of plain Python objects, not very API friendly:

  >>> json.dumps(Contact.objects.all())
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  TypeError: Contact(id=1, name='Kurt', ...) ... is not JSON serializable

But at least we know our data, so let's get to building the API
response with glom.

First, let's set our source object, conventionally named *target*:

>>> target = Contact.objects.all()  # here we could do filtering, etc.

Next, let's specify the format of our result. Remember, the processing
is not happening here, this is just declaring the format. We'll be
going over the specifics of what each line does after we get our
results.

>>> spec = {'results': [{'id': 'id',
...                      'name': 'name',
...                      'add_date': ('add_date', str),
...                      'emails': ('emails', [{'id': 'id',
...                                             'email': 'email',
...                                             'type': 'email_type'}]),
...                      'primary_email': Coalesce('primary_email.email', default=None),
...                      'pref_name': Coalesce('pref_name', 'name', skip='', default=''),
...                      'detail': Coalesce('company',
...                                         'location',
...                                         ('add_date.year', str),
...                                         skip='', default='')}]}


With *target* and *spec* in hand, we're ready to glom, build our
response, and take a look the final json-serialized form:

>>> resp = glom(target, spec)
>>> print(json.dumps(resp, indent=2, sort_keys=True))
{
  "results": [
    {
      "add_date": "20...",
      "detail": "Mountain View",
      "emails": [
        {
          "email": "kurt@example.com",
          "id": 1,
          "type": "personal"
        }
      ],
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Kurt",
      "pref_name": "Kurt",
      "primary_email": "kurt@example.com"
    },
...
}

As we can see, our response looks a lot like our glom
specification. This type of WYSIWYG code is one of glom's most
important features. After we've appreciated that simple fact, let's
look at it line by line.

Understanding the Specification
===============================

For ``id`` and ``name``, we're just doing simple copy-overs. For
``add_date``, we use a tuple to denote repeated gloms; we access
``add_date`` and pass the result to ``str`` to convert it to a string.

For emails we need to serialize a list of subobjects. Good news, glom
subgloms just fine, too. We use a tuple to access ``emails``, iterate
over that list, and from each we copy over ``id`` and ``email``. Note
how ``email_type`` is easily remapped to simply ``type``.

For ``primary_email`` we see our first usage of glom's ``Coalesce``
feature. Much like SQL's keyword of the same name, ``Coalesce``
returns the result of the first spec that returns a valid value. In
our case, ``primary_email`` can be None, so a further access of
``primary_email.email`` would, outside of glom, result in an
AttributeError or TypeError like the one we described before the
Contact example. Inside of a glom ``Coalesce``, exceptions are caught
and we move on to the next spec. glom raises a
:class:`~glom.CoalesceError` when no specs match, so we use
``default`` to tell it to return None instead.

Some Contacts have nicknames or other names they prefer to go by, so
for ``pref_name``, we want to return the stored ``pref_name``, or fall
back to the normal name. Again, we use :class:`~glom.Coalesce`, but
this time we tell it not only to ignore the default
:exc:`~glom.GlomError` exceptions, but also ignore empty string
values, and finally default to empty string if all specs result in
empty strings or :exc:`~glom.GlomError`.

And finally, for our last field, ``detail``, we want to conjure up a
bit of info that'll help jog the user's memory. We're going to include
the location, or company, or year the contact was added. You can see
an example of this feature as implemented by GitHub, here:
https://github.com/mahmoud/glom/stargazers

Conclusion
==========

We've seen a crash course in how glom can tame your data and act as a
powerful source of code coherency. glom transforms not only your data,
but also your code, bringing it in line with the data itself.

glom tamed our nested data, avoiding tedious, bug-prone lines,
replacing what would have been large sections with code that was
declarative, but flexible, an ideal balance for maintainability.
